Personal porfolio/resume website

orlandomoya.com

A basic single page website built using HTML and CSS. Some light javascript is used to animate the sections. This is my second attempt at a website and I learn a lot about animating my CSS with transitions and transforms. There are some problems that need to clean up, such as redundant code and code duplicate in my CSS, but overall I am happy with the result. The site functions fine in full desktop or in mobile mode, but has issues that need to be fixed when viewed in a half window.
